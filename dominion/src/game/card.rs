/// The Card trait that each card should implement
///
/// Several macros exist for quickly defining simple cards or effects; see
/// the [`dominion_macros`] crate documentation for those.
/// If this trait is manually implemented, `#[typetag::serde]`
/// must be placed before the line containing `impl Card for`.
///
/// The most basic implementation of a new card with custom behavior looks
/// like the following:
/// ```
/// use dominion::cards::prelude::*;
///
/// card!(MyCard);
/// #[typetag::serde]
/// impl Card for MyCard {
///     name!("My Card");
///     cost!(5);
///     types!(vec![Action]);
///
///     // Add your custom behavior here
/// }
/// ```
///
/// If you are making a crate with custom cards and would like to document the
/// cards, you have to declare the card struct by hand, e.g.:
/// ```
/// use dominion::cards::prelude::*;
///
/// /// This is my custom card!
/// #[derive(Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
/// pub struct MyCard;
///
/// #[typetag::serde]
/// impl Card for MyCard {
///     name!("My Card");
///     cost!(5);
///     types!(vec![Action]);
///
///     // Add your custom behavior here
/// }
/// ```
///
/// All other methods are optional, though for certain card types it doesn't
/// make sense not to have custom implementations for some of these methods.
/// For example, all action cards should generally implement `effects_on_play()`,
/// and all victory cards should implement `victory_points()`. Note that every
/// method from print_types() onward is automatically implemented and should
/// probably not be overridden.
///
